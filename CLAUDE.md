# CLAUDE.md — octo-common-services

Shared .NET infrastructure libraries used across all OctoMesh backend services. See `README.md`
for the published package list. Targets .NET 10, DebugL for local development.

## Build / Test

```bash
dotnet build Octo.Common.Services.sln -c DebugL
dotnet test  Octo.Common.Services.sln -c DebugL --filter "FullyQualifiedName!~SystemTests"
```

Propagate the produced `Meshmakers.Octo.Services.*.999.0.0.nupkg` files from `bin/DebugL/` into
`../nuget` so downstream services (Asset-Repo, Reporting, Identity, ...) pick up local changes.

## Multi-Tenancy Middleware

`UseOctoTenants()` (`src/Infrastructure/Configuration/ApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs`) registers
`TenantMiddleware` (`src/Infrastructure/Middleware/TenantMiddleware.cs`). For every tenant-scoped
route it resolves the tenant repository (404 if the tenant does not exist) and stores it in
`context.Items`. When the hosting feature `CanBeEnabled()` and is NOT enabled for the tenant, the
middleware short-circuits with **403 Forbidden**.

### Enabled-gate exemptions (AB#4287)

The 403 enabled-gate is skipped for:

- The exact `SystemEndpoints` paths: `/system`, `/signin-oidc`, `/healthz`.
- **Feature lifecycle endpoints** — any path ending in `/enable` or `/disable`
  (case-insensitive). These endpoints manage the enabled-state itself, so gating them would make a
  disabled feature impossible to re-enable via its own API (the AB#4287 regression: tenant-scoped
  `POST {tenantId}/v1/reporting/enable` returned 403 once reporting was disabled). Tenant resolution
  (404-if-missing + `context.Items`) still runs for these paths — only the enabled-check is skipped.

This relaxation is safe for all consumers: the gate only fires when `CanBeEnabled()` is `true`, and
services with no toggleable feature (e.g. Identity Services) never define `/enable` `/disable`
tenant routes, so their behaviour is unchanged.

## Tests

`tests/Infrastructure.Tests` — xUnit + FakeItEasy. `Infrastructure.csproj` exposes internals to this
assembly via `<InternalsVisibleTo Include="Infrastructure.Tests" />` so internal middleware such as
`TenantMiddleware` can be unit-tested directly (see `Middleware/TenantMiddlewareTests.cs`).
